************ Q&A section *************************
Q: What is the functionality of this application?

A: This application allows users to interact with each other via text in real time.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How to setup a username?

A: When the application first renders it will prompt you to create a username. This is needed so others will know who they are communicating with. If you decide to skip the process of creating a username you will simply be displayed as an anonymous.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: If I log outside of the app and log back in with the same name can I continue with my same messages?

A: Absolutely. If you so happen to log off and return with the same username as previously your messages will be kept and you can continue to message others.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Q: How do I know which messages are mine?

A: Your messages will be on the right side of the screen with a blue background. The left side of the screen will display messages by other users, these will be displayed with a gray background.
